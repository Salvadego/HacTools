# Contributing to HybrisTools

I would love your input! I want to make contributing to HybrisTools as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

I use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code follows the existing style.
5. Issue that pull request!

### Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Salvadego/HacTools/issues/new); it's that easy!

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use Go's standard formatting (`go fmt`)
* Run `golint` and `go vet` before submitting your code
